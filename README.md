# IprwcClient

This is an Angular front-end for a PoC webshop as part of a school project. It can create, read, update and delete products, wishlist items and shopping cart items in the database on the back-end, depending on the user's privilges. There is of course no shipping or payment as this is only a PoC.

Possible code improvements:
- Using Angular modules

Check out https://github.com/mr0x13f/iprwc-api/ for the corresponding back-end.
